# MNIST CRNN Project

This project implements a CRNN model for synthetic MNIST sequence recognition using PyTorch.

## Project Structure

- **datasets/**: Contains the SyntheticMNISTSequence dataset and collate functions.
- **models/**: Contains the CRNN model and its greedy decoder.
- **training/**: Contains training and evaluation routines.
- **main.py**: The main script to run training and evaluation.
- **requirements.txt**: Project dependencies.

## Setup

Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

Run the project:
\`\`\`bash
python main.py
\`\`\`
